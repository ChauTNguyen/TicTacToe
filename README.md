# TicTacToe
A super simple tic-tac-toe game in Java. Used the Swing library for the first time. This took me many hours to finish (in one day). There's a lot I could improve. I was trying to implement the game through the MVC way (studied someone's else code online), but I couldn't; Due to that, I decided to change the Model.java to Logic.java because I'm not actually doing the MVC way correctly..</br>

Over time I'll improve this (the Logic/Controller are gonna need heavy work).
