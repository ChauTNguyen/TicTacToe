# TicTacToe
A super simple tic-tac-toe game in Java. Used the Swing library for the first time. This took me many hours to finish (in one day). There's a lot I could improve. I was trying to implement the game through the MVC way (studied someone's else code online).

edit: Trying to adhere to the MVC rules. Model shouldn't know about V&C.
